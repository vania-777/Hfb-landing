        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>High Functioning Brains (HFB) is committed to empowering neurodiverse individuals, families, and clinicians through technology that prioritizes privacy, community, and actionable insights. Our mission is to bridge the gap between fragmented tools and create a unified ecosystem where neurodiverse voices are heard, supported, and respected.</p>
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>We envision a future where neurodiverse communities no longer face isolation or disconnection. By offering structured outcomes data, secure communication tools, and verified networks, HFB aims to become the trusted digital hub that helps families, professionals, and individuals achieve long-term independence, collaboration, and growth.</p>
        <h3>Why Now</h3>
        <p>The need has never been greater: with over <strong>61.8 million people on the spectrum globally</strong>, current solutions are fragmented and leave families and clinicians struggling with isolated data silos.
