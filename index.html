          <div class="content">
            The need has never been greater: with <strong>61.8 million people</strong> on the spectrum globally,
            current solutions are fragmented and leave families and clinicians struggling with isolated data silos.
            HFB provides a timely, scalable, and privacy-first platform that enables better decisions,
            coordinated care, and sustainable outcomes.
