        <summary><span>Our Vision</span></summary>
        <div class="pill-content">
          We envision a future where neurodiverse communities no longer face isolation or disconnection. By offering structured outcomes data and secure communication tools, HFB aims to become the trusted digital hub that helps families, professionals, and individuals achieve longâ€‘term independence, collaboration, and growth.

        <summary><span>Why Now</span></summary>
        <div class="pill-content">
          The timing is right: diagnoses and lateâ€‘diagnosis awareness are rising, while privacy standards (HIPAA/GDPR) and modern infrastructure make secure dataâ€‘sharing feasible. Reimbursement is shifting toward outcomes. AIâ€‘assisted workflows can reduce admin burdenâ€”if theyâ€™re built on verified, privacyâ€‘first data. HFB brings these pieces together into a trusted, structured, and scalable platform.

          61.8M+ people on the spectrum globally still face fragmented tools, siloed data, and inconsistent support. Families juggle multiple apps and adâ€‘hoc solutions; clinicians lack a unified view to coordinate care.
