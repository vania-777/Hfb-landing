## What is the Conscious Core?

The **Conscious Core** is HFB’s central symbol and philosophy. It blends science and compassion to reflect how real lives and real data can inform better tools.

### Visual language
- **Crystal diamond** — clarity, integrity, and multidimensional thinking.
- **Lotus** — awareness, resilience, and growth from within.
- **DNA helix** — science, inheritance, and our commitment to evidence.

### Principles
1. **Privacy-first** — Your data, your control.
2. **Evidence-led** — Decisions guided by rigorous science and lived experience.
3. **Inclusion** — Tools that respect neurodivergent patterns and strengths.

### Why it matters
Families and individuals deserve trusted tools. The Conscious Core is a reminder that empathy and rigor are not opposites — they are partners.
