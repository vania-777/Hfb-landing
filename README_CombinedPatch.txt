HFB Combined Patch — RF-524.3
============================
What's inside:
- about.html  (shows **Consciousness Core** image at top-center)
- investor.html  (restores **Contact** block with mailto)
- assets/theme.css + theme-toggle.js  (DARK → DIM → LIGHT toggle)
- assets/conscious_core.png (placeholder — replace with your real artwork if available)

How to deploy (easy):
1) Upload `about.html` and `investor.html` to the repo root (replace existing).
2) Upload `assets/theme.css`, `assets/theme-toggle.js`, and `assets/conscious_core.png` into `/assets/`.
3) Open pages with cache-buster once: `/about.html?rf=524.3` and `/investor.html?rf=524.3`.
4) Logo is **unchanged** (we do not overwrite your logo files).

Optional:
- Change the email in investor.html if needed.
- Replace `assets/conscious_core.png` with your final high‑res transparent image.

Love & clarity ✨
