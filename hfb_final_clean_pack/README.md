# HFB Landing (final clean pack)

This is the final minimal one-page site for High Functioning Brains.

### Files
- `CNAME` â†’ custom domain (`highfunctioningbrains.com`)
- `index.html` + `styles.css`
- `images/logo.png` (replace with your 3D logo if needed, keep the same name)
- `images/bg_neural.svg` (very faint neural watermark background)

### PDF links
Keep your PDFs in the repo root with **exact** names:
- `HFB_Full_Proposal.pdf`
- `HFB_Investor_Pack.pdf`

### Deploy
Push these files to your `main` branch in GitHub. GitHub Pages will deploy automatically.
If you see cache, open the site with `?cache=v2` once.
