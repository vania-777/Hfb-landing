# LinkedIn Post #2 — Introducing the HFB Landing Page (Draft)

Today we’re sharing the first public snapshot of HFB’s direction: a lightweight landing page built around three promises—Clear Need, Privacy First, Focused MVP.

Why this matters:
• It keeps us honest: we start with real problems and test them in the open.
• It protects our community: consent-forward design and minimal data collection.
• It keeps momentum: a small, useful MVP > a big, unfinished plan.

What’s next:
• Finalize the investor PDFs (Proposal + Pitch Deck) and publish them on the page.
• Open a waitlist for early collaborators (parents, clinicians, educators).
• Share a build thread to document our iterations.

If this resonates, follow along and tell us what the clearest “Day 1” feature is for you. Your stories shape our roadmap. #Neurodiversity #PrivacyByDesign #MVP #HFB

**Now live:** A tracker‑free **waitlist** form on the landing page (demo client‑side only).  
If this resonates, join the waitlist and tell us your clearest “Day 1” feature. Your stories shape our roadmap.


**Build Thread:** We’re documenting progress here: `/build.html` (transparent, iteration-first).
